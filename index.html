        <p>The Scribery project is an effort to design and implement an Open-Source
solution for recording user sessions on Linux systems.</p>

<p>Many companies need to have their systems used, or even managed by people they
don’t entirely trust: contractors, outsourced support, peripheral IT staff,
etc. It helps to know what these users or operators were doing on your
systems, or even what they’re doing right now, so you can not only prevent
repeated issues, but also stop an incident about to happen.</p>

<p>Government, medical and certain other organizations can be required by law to
collect recordings of user sessions. Financial organizations require tight
tracking of what's happening on their systems. Support desks also appreciate a
way to look back at what exactly led to an issue, so they don’t need to talk
through a user’s recollection of events.</p>

<p>We're working on supporting recording of text terminal sessions (e.g. login at
the console, via SSH, or telnet). The recorded data includes what user enters
into the terminal and sees on the screen, what commands the user executes,
what files he/she accesses and how, and other data relevant to the session.</p>

<p>To support centralized architecture and to take the recording away from the
user system where it cannot be kept safely, we stream it via the conventional
logging system to a central storage. Then, the auditors, or support, can
search, correlate, and playback the recordings from that central location.</p>

<p>The solution is being integrated with a central identity and policy management
system, so that administrators could specify which users to record where
centrally.</p>

management system. Optional.</p>
</blockquote>

commands executed and files accessed. Optional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/">Rsyslogd</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A logging server, which collects both the recorded terminal I/O, and audit
messages, then massages and sends them to the central storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<a id="server-side" class="anchor" href="#server-side" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Server side</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.freeipa.org/">FreeIPA</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A central identity and policy management solution responsible for

which hosts. Optional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">ElasticSearch</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The central storage for the recordings. Can also serve as the storage of
logs in general. Can be used for searching and correlation with the help of
visualization solutions such as <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tlog-play</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A basic command-line session playback tool. Can be used to test the setup
and quickly playback sessions from the command line. A part of <a href="http://scribery.github.io/tlog/">tlog</a>.
Optional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Web UI</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A session playback web UI component, which can join the terminal I/O and
audit data for searching and correlation within specific sessions. To be
implemented.</p>

<p>At the moment the base terminal I/O recording and playback is implemented in
tlog, its <a href="https://github.com/Scribery/tlog/releases">packages</a> are available on GitHub and in the
upcoming Fedora 24.</p>

<p>Right now we're working on integrating tlog with SSSD and FreeIPA, making
Auditd stream messages to ElasticSearch and are starting implementing the web
UI playback component.</p>
